                1.0 caNanoLab Introduction and background
================================================================
Welcome to the cancer Nanotechnology Laboratory (caNanoLab) portal. caNanoLab is
a data sharing portal designed to facilitate information sharing in the biomedical
nanotechnology research community to expedite and validate the use of nanotechnology
in biomedicine. caNanoLab provides support for the annotation of nanomaterials with
characterizations resulting from physico-chemical and in vitro assays and the sharing
of these characterizations and associated nanotechnology protocols in a secure fashion.
