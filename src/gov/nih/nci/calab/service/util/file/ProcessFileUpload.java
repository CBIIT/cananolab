/**
 * This servlet is called up by the HttpFileUploadApplet to process files
 * that are sent from the client machines. It does several things.  First
 * it extracts meta data about the incoming file, and converts them into
 * a HttpUploadedFileData object. It then reads file and writes them to 
 * the designated directory on the file server.  Thirdly, depending on 
 * a boolean setting of the HttpFileUploadCache object, it deletes the files
 * it just wrote if isStopped flag is set to true, otherwise do nothing. Lastly
 * if the isStopped flag is set to false, it adds HttpUploadedFileData object
 * to the HttpFileUploadCache object to be used by the subsequent file
 * parsing service.
