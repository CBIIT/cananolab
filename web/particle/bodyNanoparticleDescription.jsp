		This is the manage nanoparticles section which allows users to enter
		information about a nanoparticle. Nanoparticle information includes
		general information about the nanoparticle, the functions of the
		nanoparticle, the nanoparticles' composition, and the physical and in
		vitro characterizations and characterization result files. In this
		section, depending on your authorization level, you may submit new
		nanoparticle information or search for an existing nanoparticle for
		editing, viewing, printing, or exporting.
