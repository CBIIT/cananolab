			Welcome to the <strong>cancer Nanotechnology Laboratory Analysis Bench (caNanoLab)! </strong>caNanoLab is a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) designed to facilitate data sharing in laboratories performing nanoparticle assays.  caNanoLab provides support for the accessioning of samples (nanoparticles), execution of nanoparticle assays, and recording of assay results.  Additionally, caNanoLab allows for  the  annotation of nanoparticles with characterizations resulting from physical and in vitro nanoparticle assays and the sharing of these characterizations in a secure fashion.
			The diagram below describes the caNanoLab functionality and workflow:
