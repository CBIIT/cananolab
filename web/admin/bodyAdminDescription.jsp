		This is the Administration section which allows users to configure
		caNanoLab's authentication and authorization policies leveraging the
		NCI's security framework, the Common Security Module (CSM). In this

		privileges using the NCI's User Provisioning Tool (UPT). Site
		administrators can also configure basic site preferences including
