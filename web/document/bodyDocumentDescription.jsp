		This is the manage documents section which allows users to submit publications and
		reports associated with a nanoparticle sample.  Publications can include review papers, 
		journals, book chapters, and other forms of published documents.  A report is a document
		generated by a research organization that may describe the composition of a nanoparticle
		and the results of physical, in vitro, and in vivo nanoparticle characterizations.  In
		this section, depending on your authorization level, you may submit a new document or
		search for an existing document.
