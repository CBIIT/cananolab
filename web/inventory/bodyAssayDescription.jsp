<h4>Manage Assay Home</h4>

This is the Assay section of the Manage Assay function.  An assay is a type of experiment performed in the 
laboratory.  Assays are contained in projects and can involve multiple samples and instruments.

In this section, you may create a new Assay, modify existing assay details, and associate assays with 
assay types.  Please begin by selecting either Create a New Assay or Select an Existing Assay. 
Once an assay is created, an assay can be leveraged in a project.
