<h4>Manage Instrument Home</h4>

This is the Instrument section of the Manage Instrument function.  An instrument is a piece of equipment 
used in a laboratory for processing samples and performing assays. 

In this section, you may create a new Instrument and modify existing instrument details.  Please begin by 
selecting either Create a New Instrument or Select an Existing Instrument. Once an instrument is created, 
an instrument can be leveraged in an assay.
