    This is the manage samples section which allows users to enter general information about the sample, detailed
    information about the composition of the sample, and information about the physico-chemical, in vitro, and other
    characterizations performed on the sample. A sample is a formulation of a base nanomaterial platform and any
    additional components that contribute to the function(s) of the nanomaterial. A sample can also be a control used in
    comparative analysis. In this section, depending on your authorization level, you may submit new sample information
    or search for an existing sample for editing, copying, viewing, printing, or exporting.
