<div class="welcomeContent">This is the Administration section
	which allows users to configure caNanoLab's authentication and
	authorization policies leveraging the NCI's security framework, the
	Common Security Module (CSM). In this section, site administrators can
	create user accounts and assign user privileges using the NCI's User
	Provisioning Tool (UPT). Site administrators can also configure basic
	site preferences including custom logos and site banners.</div>
