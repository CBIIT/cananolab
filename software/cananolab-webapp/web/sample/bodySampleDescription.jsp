	This is the manage samples section which allows users to enter general
	information about the sample, detailed information about the
	composition of the sample, and information about the physico-chemical,
	<i>in vitro</i>, and other characterizations performed on the sample. A
	sample is a formulation of a base nanomaterial platform and any
	additional components that contribute to the function(s) of the
	nanomaterial. A sample can also be a control used in comparative
	analysis. In this section, depending on your authorization level, you
	may submit new sample information or search for an existing sample for
	editing, copying, viewing, printing, or exporting.
