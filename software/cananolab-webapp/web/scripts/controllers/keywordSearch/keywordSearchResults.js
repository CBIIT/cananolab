The development of peptide-major histocompatibility (p/MHC) tetrameric complexes has enabled the direct detection of these antigen-specific T cells. With the goal of increasing throughput and multiplexing of T cell detection, protein microarrays spotted with defined p/MHC complexes have been reported, but studies have been limited due to the inherent instability and reproducibility of arrays produced via conventional spotted methods. Herein, we report on a platform for the detection of antigen-specific T cells on glass substrates that offers significant advantages over existing surface-bound schemes. In this approach, called \"Nucleic Acid Cell Sorting (NACS)\", single-stranded DNA oligomers conjugated site-specifically to p/MHC tetramers are employed to immobilize p/MHC tetramers via hybridization to a complementary-printed substrate. Fully assembled p/MHC arrays are used to detect and enumerate T cells captured from cellular suspensions, including primary human T cells collected from cancer patients. NACS arrays outperform conventional spotted arrays assessed in key criteria such as repeatability and homogeneity. The versatility of employing DNA sequences for cell sorting is exploited to enable the programmed, selective release of target populations of immobilized T cells with restriction endonucleases for downstream analysis. Because of the performance, facile and modular assembly of p/MHC tetramer arrays, NACS holds promise as a versatile platform for multiplexed T cell detection.","id":"26345502","pubmedId":"19552409","fileId":"","editable":false},{"type":"publication","name":"In vitro and in vivo imaging studies of a new endohedral metallofullerene nanoparticle.","createdDate":"200903101826","description":"PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a functionalized trimetallic nitride endohedral metallofullerene nanoparticle as a magnetic resonance (MR) imaging proton relaxation agent and to follow its distribution for in vitro agarose gel infusions and in vivo infusions in rat brain.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: The animal study was approved by the animal care and use committee. Gd(3)N@C(80) was functionalized with poly(ethylene glycol) units, and the carbon cage was hydroxylated to provide improved water solubility and biodistribution. Relaxation rate measurements (R1 = 1/T1 and R2 = 1/T2) of water solutions of this contrast agent were conducted at 0.35-, 2.4-, and 9.4-T MR imaging. Images of contrast agent distributions were produced following infusions in six agarose gel samples at 2.4 T and from direct brain infusions into normal and tumor-bearing rat brain at 2.4 T. The relaxivity of a control functionalized lutetium agent, Lu(3)N@C(80), was also determined.\r\nRESULTS: Water hydrogen MR imaging relaxivity (r1) for this metallofullerene nanoparticle was markedly higher than that for commercial agents (eg, gadodiamide); r1 values of 102, 143, and 32 L . mmol(-1) . sec(-1) were measured at 0.35, 2.4, and 9.4 T, respectively. In studies of in vitro agarose gel infusion, the use of functionalized Gd(3)N@C(80) at concentrations an order of magnitude lower resulted in equivalent visualization in comparison with commercial agents. Comparable contrast enhancement was obtained with direct infusions of 0.013 mmol/L of Gd(3)N@C(80) and 0.50 mmol/L of gadodiamide in live normal rat brain. Elapsed-time studies demonstrated lower diffusion rates for Gd(3)N@C(80) relative to gadodiamide in live normal rat brain tissue. Functionalized metallofullerenes directly infused into a tumor-bearing brain provided an improved tumor delineation in comparison with the intravenously injected conventional Gd(3+) chelate. A control lutetium functionalized Lu(3)N@C(80) nanoparticle exhibited very low MR imaging relaxivity. CONCLUSION: The new functionalized trimetallic nitride endohedral metallofullerene species Gd(3)N@C(80)[DiPEG5000(OH)(x)] is an effective proton relaxation agent, as demonstrated with in vitro relaxivity and MR imaging studies, in infusion experiments with agarose gel and in vivo rat brain studies simulating clinical conditions of direct intraparenchymal drug delivery for the treatment of brain tumors.","id":"11730945","pubmedId":"16837672","fileId":null,"editable":false},{"type":"publication","name":"Long-term follow-up after non-myeloablative transplant of bone and marrow in BXSB mice.","createdDate":"201004291848","description":"We present long-term outcomes of BXSB mice after non-myeloablative bone marrow transplants using major histocompatability complex (MHC)-matched cells.

As a source of mesenchymal cells, bone chips from GFP-Tg were injected intraperitoneally alone (MSC group) or along with i.v. bone marrow cells (BMT + MSC group). Controls were untreated mice (UnTx) or mice exposed to radiation only (Rad Cont). At 62 weeks post-transplant, surviving mice were harvested for histopathology, flow cytometry and real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The mice from BMT + MSC group had the best outcomes for survival rates (71.4% vs. 43.8%), renal scores (2.9% vs. 28.8% glomerular sclerosis) and percent splenic monocytes (4.2 vs. 11.3%) compared with mice from Rad Cont. Improvement in RAG and BMT groups was less prominent but were comparable with one another. Although MSC alone were not sufficient to control the renal pathology, it limited the expansion of CD4(-)CD8(-) T cell populations without a change in Foxp3 expression. The results suggest the importance of the innate immune system in disease pathogenesis and a role for MSC in immunomodulation.","id":"26345494","pubmedId":"19578106","fileId":null,"editable":false},{"type":"publication","name":"siRNA delivery into human T cells and primary cells with carbon-nanotube transporters.","createdDate":"200812262054","description":"","id":"11042859","pubmedId":"17290476","fileId":null,"editable":false},{"type":"publication","name":"Proposed triaxial atomic force microscope contact-free tweezers for nanoassembly","createdDate":"201004291847","description":"We propose a triaxial atomic force microscope contact-free tweezer (TACT) for the controlled assembly of nanoparticles suspended in a liquid.

The objective of the present study was to characterize the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of C6-ceramide and control (non-C6-ceramide) nanoliposomes in rats, using [14C]-C6-ceramide and [3H]-DSPC (distearylphosphatidylcholine) as tracers of the ceramide and liposome components, respectively. Ceramide liposomes were administered at 50 mg liposome/kg by jugular vein to female S.D. rats. The apparent volume of distribution (Vd) of [3H]-DSPC was 50 mL/kg, suggesting that liposome was confined to the systemic circulation. By contrast, the Vd of [14C]-C6-ceramide was 20-fold greater than that of liposome, indicating extensive tissue distribution. This high Vd of [14C]-C6-ceramide in relation to [3H]-DSPC suggests that ceramide and liposome distribute independently of each other. This disparate disposition was confirmed by tissue distribution studies, in which [14C]-C6-ceramide exhibited rapid tissue accumulation in comparison to [3H]-DSPC. Examination of ceramide liposome blood compartmentalization in vitro also demonstrated divergent partitioning, with liposome confined to the plasma fraction, and ceramide rapidly equilibrating between red blood cell and plasma fractions. A bilayer exchange mechanism for ceramide transfer is proposed to explain the results of the present study, as well as give insight into the documented anti-neoplastic efficacy of short-chain ceramide liposomes.
