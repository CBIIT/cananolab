Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and its cell surface receptor (uPAR) are central molecules in one of the major protease systems involved in extracellular matrix degradation. Noninvasive imaging of this receptor in vivo with radiolabeled peptides that specifically target uPAR may therefore be useful to decipher the potential invasiveness of malignant lesions. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this study, we developed a (64)Cu-labeled uPAR-binding peptide for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. A linear, high-affinity uPAR-binding peptide antagonist AE105 was conjugated with 1,4,7,10-tetraazadodecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) and labeled with (64)Cu for microPET imaging of mice bearing U87MG human glioblastoma (uPAR positive) and MDA-MB-435 human breast cancer (uPAR negative). RESULTS: Surface plasmon resonance measurements show that AE105 with DOTA conjugated at the alpha-amino group (DOTA-AE105) has high affinity toward uPAR. microPET imaging reveals a rapid and high accumulation of (64)Cu-DOTA-AE105 in uPAR-positive U87MG tumors (10.8 +/- 1.5%ID/g at 4.5 hours, n = 3) but not in uPAR-negative MDA-MB-435 tumors (1.2 +/- 0.6%ID/g at 4.5 hours, n = 3). Specificity of this peptide-based imaging of uPAR was validated by further control experiments. First, a nonbinding variant of AE105 carrying a single amino acid replacement (Trp-->Glu) does not target U87MG tumors in vivo. Second, targeting of U87MG tumors by (64)Cu-DOTA-AE105 is specifically inhibited by a nonlabeled antagonist. CONCLUSION: The successful demonstration of the ability of a (64)Cu labeled uPAR-specific probe to visualize uPAR expression in vivo may allow clinical translation of this class of radiopharmaceuticals for uPAR-positive cancer detection and patient stratification for uPA/uPAR system-based cancer therapy.","id":"26345740","pubmedId":"18676745","fileId":null,"editable":false},{"type":"publication","name":"In vitro and in vivo imaging studies of a new endohedral metallofullerene nanoparticle.","createdDate":"200903101826","description":"PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a functionalized trimetallic nitride endohedral metallofullerene nanoparticle as a magnetic resonance (MR) imaging proton relaxation agent and to follow its distribution for in vitro agarose gel infusions and in vivo infusions in rat brain.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: The animal study was approved by the animal care and use committee. Gd(3)N@C(80) was functionalized with poly(ethylene glycol) units, and the carbon cage was hydroxylated to provide improved water solubility and biodistribution. Relaxation rate measurements (R1 = 1/T1 and R2 = 1/T2) of water solutions of this contrast agent were conducted at 0.35-, 2.4-, and 9.4-T MR imaging. Images of contrast agent distributions were produced following infusions in six agarose gel samples at 2.4 T and from direct brain infusions into normal and tumor-bearing rat brain at 2.4 T. The relaxivity of a control functionalized lutetium agent, Lu(3)N@C(80), was also determined.\r\nRESULTS: Water hydrogen MR imaging relaxivity (r1) for this metallofullerene nanoparticle was markedly higher than that for commercial agents (eg, gadodiamide); r1 values of 102, 143, and 32 L . mmol(-1) . sec(-1) were measured at 0.35, 2.4, and 9.4 T, respectively. In studies of in vitro agarose gel infusion, the use of functionalized Gd(3)N@C(80) at concentrations an order of magnitude lower resulted in equivalent visualization in comparison with commercial agents. Comparable contrast enhancement was obtained with direct infusions of 0.013 mmol/L of Gd(3)N@C(80) and 0.50 mmol/L of gadodiamide in live normal rat brain. Elapsed-time studies demonstrated lower diffusion rates for Gd(3)N@C(80) relative to gadodiamide in live normal rat brain tissue.

Clinical results for EGFR targeting with specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) such as cetuximab and panitumumab are promising; however, most studies indicate that only a subgroup of patients receiving the mAbs benefit from the immunotherapy, independent of EGFR expression level. To understand the in vivo kinetics of antibody delivery and localization, we performed small-animal PET studies with (64)Cu-labeled panitumumab in xenografts derived from 3 cell lines of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). METHODS: Nude mice bearing HNSCC tumors with different levels of EGFR expression were imaged with small-animal PET using (64)Cu-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid (DOTA)-panitumumab. Antibody distribution in the tumors was confirmed by ex vivo immunostaining using panitumumab and fluorescein 5(6)-isothiocyanate (FITC) panitumumab. CD31 immunostaining and Evans blue assay were also performed to assess the tumor vascular density and permeability. RESULTS: Among these 3 tumor models, UM-SCC-22B tumors with the lowest EGFR protein expression showed the highest (64)Cu-DOTA-panitumumab accumulation, whereas SQB20 tumors with the highest EGFR expression showed the lowest (64)Cu-DOTA-panitumumab accumulation. Ex vivo staining demonstrated that SQB20 cells still had extremely high EGFR expression after forming tumors in nude mice, indicating that the low uptake of (64)Cu-DOTA-panitumumab in SQB20 tumors was not due to the loss of EGFR expression. The results from CD31 immunostaining and Evans blue permeability assay suggest that the low vessel density, poor vascular permeability, and binding site barrier are likely responsible for the overall low tumor uptake of the highly EGFR-expressing SQB20 tumors. CONCLUSION: The results from this study provide a possible explanation for the lack of an observed correlation between therapeutic efficacy of cetuximab and panitumumab and EGFR expression level as determined by immunohistochemistry or fluorescent in situ hybridization and may shed new light on the complications of anti-EGFR mAb therapy for HNSCC and other malignancies.","id":"26345508","pubmedId":"19525473","fileId":null,"editable":true},{"type":"publication","name":"Small-animal PET of tumors with (64)Cu-labeled RGD-bombesin heterodimer.","createdDate":"201004291848","description":"The overexpression of gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) in various tumor types suggests that GRPR is an attractive target for cancer imaging and therapy with radiolabeled bombesin analogs.

It has been shown that MRI can detect and quantify specific molecules of interest expressed in cardiovascular disease and cancer by measuring the unique fluorine signature of appropriately targeted perfluorocarbon (PFC) nanoparticles. In this study, we demonstrated specific binding of alphanubeta3 integrin targeted nanoparticles to neovasculature in a rabbit model of aortic valve disease. We also showed that fluorine MRI could be used to detect and quantify the development of neovasculature in the excised aortic valve leaflets. METHODS: New Zealand White rabbits consumed a cholesterol diet for ~180 days and developed aortic valve thickening, inflammation, and angiogenesis mimicking early human aortic valve disease. Rabbits (n = 7) were treated with alphanubeta3 integrin targeted PFC nanoparticles or control untargeted PFC nanoparticles (n = 6). Competitive inhibition in vivo of nanoparticle binding (n = 4) was tested by pretreatment with targeted nonfluorinated nanoparticles followed 2 hours later by targeted PFC nanoparticles. 2 hours after treatment, aortic valves were excised and 19F MRS was performed at 11.7T. Integrated 19F spectral peaks were compared using a one-way ANOVA and Hsu's MCB (multiple comparisons with the best) post hoc t test. In 3 additional rabbits treated with alphanubeta3 integrin targeted PFC nanoparticles, 19F spectroscopy was performed on a 3.0T clinical scanner. The presence of angiogenesis was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Valves of rabbits treated with targeted PFC nanoparticles had 220% more fluorine signal than valves of rabbits treated with untargeted PFC nanoparticles (p < 0.001). Pretreatment of rabbits with targeted oil-based nonsignaling nanoparticles reduced the fluorine signal by 42% due to competitive inhibition, to a level not significantly different from control animals. Nanoparticles were successfully detected in all samples scanned at 3.0T. PECAM endothelial staining and alphanubeta3 integrin staining revealed the presence of neovasculature within the valve leaflets. CONCLUSION: Integrin-targeted PFC nanoparticles specifically detect early angiogenesis in sclerotic aortic valves of cholesterol fed rabbits. These techniques may be useful for assessing atherosclerotic components of preclinical aortic valve disease in patients and could assist in defining efficacy of medical therapies.","id":"26345785","pubmedId":"18817557","fileId":null,"editable":true},{"type":"publication","name":"Cationic shell-crosslinked knedel-like nanoparticles for highly efficient gene and oligonucleotide transfection of mammalian cells.","createdDate":"200906261543","description":"In this work, a robust synthetic nanostructure was designed for the effective packaging of DNA and it was shown to be an efficient agent for cell transfection.

The approach combines mass spectrometry with self-assembled monolayers that present acetylated peptides and enables a label-free and one-step assay of this biochemical activity. The assay was used to characterize the activity of HDAC8 toward peptides taken from the N-terminal tail of the H4 histone and reveals that a distal region of the peptide substrate interacts with the deacetylase at an exosite and contributes to the activity of the substrate. Specifically, a peptide corresponding to residues 8 19 of H4 and having lysine 12 acetylated is an active substrate, but removal of the KRHR (residues 16 19) sequence abolishes activity. Mutation of glycine 11 to arginine in the peptide lacking the KRHR sequence restores activity, demonstrating that both local and distal sequences act synergistically to regulate the activity of the HDAC. Assays with peptides bearing multiply acetylated residues, but in which each acetyl group is isotopically labeled, permit studies of the processive deacetylation of peptides.

In this protocol, we describe the detailed procedure for the preparation of such peptide-conjugated QDs using commercially available PEG-coated QDs and arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptides. Conjugation of the thiolated RGD peptide to the QDs was achieved through a heterobifunctional linker, 4-maleimidobutyric acid N-succinimidyl ester. Competitive cell binding assay, using (125)I-echistatin as the radioligand, and live cell staining were carried out to confirm the successful attachment of the RGD peptides to the QD surface before in vivo imaging of tumor-bearing mice. In general, QD conjugation and in vitro validation of the peptide-conjugated QDs can be accomplished within 1-2 d; in vivo imaging will take another 1-2 d depending on the experimental design.","id":"26345939","pubmedId":"18193025","fileId":null,"editable":true},{"type":"publication","name":"CD200 is induced by ERK and is a potential therapeutic target in melanoma.","createdDate":"201004291901","description":"Immune-mediated antitumor responses occur in patients with metastatic melanoma (MM), and therapies designed to augment such responses are clinically beneficial. Despite the immunogenicity of melanoma, immunomodulatory therapies fail in the majority of patients with MM. An inability of DCs to sufficiently activate effector cells may, in part, underlie this failure of the antitumor response seen in most patients. In this work, we show that mutation of N-RAS or B-RAF, signature genetic lesions present in most MMs, potently induced the expression of cell-surface CD200, a repressor of DC function. Employing 2 independent, genome-wide microarray analyses, we identified CD200 as a highly dynamic, downstream target of RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK activation in melanoma. CD200 protein was similarly overexpressed in human melanoma cell lines and primary tumors. CD200 mRNA expression correlated with progression and was higher in melanoma than in other solid tumors or acute leukemia. Melanoma cell lines expressing endogenous CD200 repressed primary T cell activation by DCs, while knockdown of CD200 by shRNA abrogated this immunosuppressive effect. These data indicate that in addition to its effects on growth, survival, and motility, ERK activation in MM attenuates a host antitumor immune response, implicating CD200 and its interaction with the CD200 receptor as a potential therapeutic target for MM.","id":"26345983","pubmedId":"18008004","fileId":null,"editable":true},{"type":"publication","name":"Evaluation of pharmacokinetics of bioreducible gene delivery vectors by real-time PCR.","createdDate":"200909291438","description":"Purpose.

A polymer-blend nanoparticle system was engineered to incorporate temporally controlled sequential release of the combination drug payload. Hereby, PTX was encapsulated in the pH-responsive rapid releasing polymer, poly(beta-amino ester) (PbAE), while CER was present in the slow releasing polymer, poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) with n these blend nanoparticles. When particle formulations were administered intravenously to MCF7 and MCF7TR tumor bearing mice, higher concentrations of PTX were found in the blood due to longer retention time and an enhanced tumor accumulation relative to administration of free drug. In addition, the PLGA/PbAE blend nanoparticles were effective in enhancing the residence time of both drugs at the tumor site by reducing systemic clearance. Overall, these results are highly encouraging for development of multifunctional polymer-blend nanoparticle formulations that can be used for temporal -controlled administration of two drugs from a single formulation.","id":"26345747","pubmedId":null,"fileId":null,"editable":true},{"type":"publication","name":"Receptor activator of NF-kappa B Ligand (RANKL) expression is associated with epithelial to mesenchymal transition in human prostate cancer cells","createdDate":"201004291854","description":"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer describes the phenotypic and behavioral changes of cancer cells from indolent to virulent forms with increased migratory, invasive and metastatic potential. EMT can be induced by soluble proteins like transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta 1) and transcription factors including Snail and Slug. We utilized the ARCaP(E)/ARCaP(M) prostate cancer progression model and LNCaP clones stably overexpressing Snail to identify novel markers associated with EMT. Compared to ARCaP(E) cells, the highly tumorigenic mesenchymal ARCaP(M) and ARCaP(M1) variant cells displayed a higher incidence of bone metastasis after intracardiac administration in SCID mice. ARCaP(M) and ARCaP(M1) expressed mesenchymal stromal markers of vimentin and N-cadherin in addition to elevated levels of Receptor Activator of NF-kappa B Ligand (RANKL). We observed that both epidermal growth factor (EGF) plus TGF beta 1 treatment and Snail overexpression induced EMT in ARCaP(E) and LNCaP cells, and EMT was associated with increased expression of RANKL protein. Finally, we determined that the RANKL protein was functionally active, promoting osteoclastogenesis in vitro. Our results indicate that RANKL is a novel marker for EMT during prostate cancer progression. RANKL may function as a link between EMT, bone turnover, and prostate cancer skeletal metastasis.","id":"26345752","pubmedId":null,"fileId":null,"editable":true},{"type":"publication","name":"Complement activation by PEGylated single-walled carbon nanotubes is independent of C1q and alternative pathway turnover","createdDate":"201004291854","description":"We have investigated the interaction between long circulating poly(ethylene glycol)-stabilized single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and the complement system.

Studies in C2-depleted serum confirmed that PEGylated nanotube-mediated elevation of SC5b-9 was C4b2a convertase-dependent. With the aid of monoclonal antibodies against C1s and human serum depleted from C1q, nanotube-mediated complement activation in C1q-depleted serum was also shown to be independent of classical pathway. Nanotube-mediated C4d elevation in C1q-depleted serum, however, was inhibited by N-acetylglucosamine, Futhan (a broad-spectrum serine protease inhibitor capable of preventing complement activation through all three pathways) and anti-MASP-2 antibodies; this strongly suggests a role for activation of MASP-2 in subsequent C4 cleavage and assembly of C4b2a covertases. Intravenous injection of PEGylated nanotubes in some rats was associated with a significant rise in plasma thromboxane B2 levels, indicative of in vivo nanotube-mediated complement activation.

The effect of MRPs was investigated on human salt taste and on the chorda tympani (CT) taste nerve responses to NaCl in Sprague-Dawley rats, wild-type, and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) knockout mice. MRPs produced a biphasic effect on human salt taste perception and on the CT responses in rats and wild-type mice in the presence of NaCl + benzamil (Bz, a blocker of epithelial Na+ channels), enhancing the NaCl response at low concentrations and suppressing it at high concentrations. The effectiveness of MRPs as salt taste enhancers varied with the conjugated sugar moiety: galacturonic acid = glucosamine > xylose > fructose > glucose. The concentrations at which MRPs enhanced human salt taste were significantly lower than the concentrations of MRPs that produced increase in the NaCl CT response. Elevated temperature, resiniferatoxin, capsaicin, and ethanol produced additive effects on the NaCl CT responses in the presence of MRPs. Elevated temperature and ethanol also enhanced human salt taste perception. N-(3-methoxyphenyl)-4-chlorocinnamid (a blocker of TRPV1t) inhibited the Bz-insensitive NaCl CT responses in the absence and presence of MRPs. TRPV1 knockout mice demonstrated no Bz-insensitive NaCl CT response in the absence or presence of MRPs.

The development of a dual-function positron emission tomography (PET)/near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) probe might allow the accurate assessment of the tumor-targeting efficacy of QDs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An amine-functionalized QD was conjugated with VEGF protein and DOTA chelator for VEGFR-targeted PET/NIRF imaging after (64)Cu-labeling. The targeting efficacy of this dual functional probe was evaluated in vitro and in vivo through cell-binding assay, cell staining, in vivo optical/PET imaging, ex vivo optical/PET imaging, and histology. RESULTS: The DOTA-QD-VEGF exhibited VEGFR-specific binding in both cell-binding assay and cell staining experiment. Both NIR fluorescence imaging and microPET showed VEGFR-specific delivery of conjugated DOTA-QD-VEGF nanoparticle and prominent reticuloendothelial system uptake. The U87MG tumor uptake of (64)Cu-labeled DOTA-QD was less than one percentage injected dose per gram (%ID/g), significantly lower than that of (64)Cu-labeled DOTA-QD-VEGF (1.52 +/- 0.6%ID/g, 2.81 +/- 0.3%ID/g, 3.84 +/- 0.4%ID/g, and 4.16 +/- 0.5%ID/g at 1, 4, 16, and 24 h post injection, respectively; n = 3).

Although it is known that ZEB1 overexpression promotes EMT primarily through down-regulation of E-cadherin in a variety of cancers, the soluble ligands responsible for the activation of ZEB1 have yet to be identified. In the present study, we investigated the role of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) in the regulation of ZEB1 during EMT associated with prostate tumor cell migration. We found that ZEB1 is expressed in highly aggressive prostate cancer cells and that its expression correlates directly with Gleason grade in human prostate tumors (P < 0.001). IGF-I up-regulates ZEB1 expression in prostate cancer cells exhibiting an epithelial phenotype. In prostate cancer cells displaying a mesenchymal phenotype, ZEB1 inhibition reverses the suppression of E-cadherin protein and down-regulates the expression of the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and fibronectin. Furthermore, ZEB1 blockade decreases migratory and invasive potential in ARCaP(M) compared with the control. These results identify ZEB1 as a key transcriptional regulator of EMT in prostate cancer and suggest that the aberrant expression of ZEB1 in prostate cancer cells occurs in part in response to IGF-I stimulation.","id":"26345880","pubmedId":"18381457","fileId":null,"editable":true},{"type":"publication","name":"18F-labeled BBN-RGD heterodimer for prostate cancer imaging.","createdDate":"201004291859","description":"Both bombesin (BBN) analogs and cyclic RGD peptides have been suitably radiolabeled for prostate cancer imaging.

We hypothesize that a peptide ligand recognizing both GRPR and integrin will be advantageous because of its dual-receptor-targeting ability. METHODS: A BBN-RGD heterodimer was synthesized from bombesin(7-14) and c(RGDyK) through a glutamate linker and then labeled with (18)F via the N-succinimidyl-4-(18)F-fluorobenzoate ((18)F-SFB) prosthetic group.

Enzyme cleavage of the complex results in an open coordination site available for water that creates a detectable MR contrast agent. The complexes consist of a DO3A Gd(III) chelator modified with a galactopyranose at the N-10 position of the macrocycle. We observed significant differences in relaxometric properties and coordination geometry that can be correlated to subtle variations of the linker between the macrocycle and the galactopyranose. After synthesis and purification of the R, S, and racemic mixtures of complexes 1 and 3 and measurement of the hydration number, water residence lifetime, and longitudinal relaxation rates, we propose mechanisms for water exclusion from the lanthanide in the precleavage state. While the stereochemistry of the linker does not influence the agents' properties, the mechanism of water exclusion for each isomer is significantly influenced by the position of modification. Data for one series with a methyl group substituted on the sugar-macrocycle linker at the alpha-position suggests a steric mechanism where the galactopyranose sugar blocks water from the Gd(III) center. In contrast, our observations for a second series with methyl substitution at the beta position of the sugar-macrocycle linker are consistent with a mechanism in which a bidentate anion occupies two available coordination sites of Gd(III) in the precleavage state.","id":"26345964","pubmedId":"18072754","fileId":null,"editable":true},{"type":"publication","name":"Micelles based on biodegradable poly(L-glutamic acid)-b-polylactide with paramagnetic Gd ions chelated to the shell layer as a potential nanoscale MRI-visible delivery system.","createdDate":"201004291900","description":"There is much interest in the development of a nanoscale drug delivery system with MRI visibility to optimize the delivery efficiency and therapeutic efficacy under image guidance.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We tested the hypothesis that inflammation promotes osteogenesis in atherosclerotic plaques using in vivo molecular imaging in apolipoprotein E-/- mice (20 to 30 weeks old, n=35). A bisphosphonate-derivatized near-infrared fluorescent imaging agent (excitation 750 nm) visualized osteogenic activity that was otherwise undetectable by x-ray computed tomography. Flow cytometry validated the target specifically in osteoblast-like cells. A spectrally distinct near-infrared fluorescent nanoparticle (excitation 680 nm) was coinjected to simultaneously image macrophages. Fluorescence reflectance mapping demonstrated an association between osteogenic activity and macrophages in aortas of apolipoprotein E-/- mice (R2=0.93). Intravital dual-channel fluorescence microscopy was used to further monitor osteogenic changes in inflamed carotid arteries at 20 and 30 weeks of age and revealed that macrophage burden and osteogenesis concomitantly increased during plaque progression (P<0.01 and P<0.001, respectively) and decreased after statin treatment (P<0.0001 and P<0.05, respectively). Fluorescence microscopy on cryosections colocalized near-infrared fluorescent osteogenic signals with alkaline phosphatase activity, bone-regulating protein expression, and hydroxyapatite nanocrystals as detected by electron microscopy, whereas von Kossa and alizarin red stains showed no evidence of calcification. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed that macrophage-conditioned media increased alkaline phosphatase mRNA expression in vascular smooth muscle cells.

Improved imaging probes that permit sensitive detection and high-resolution characterization of tumor angiogenesis could improve patient risk-benefit stratification. The overarching objective of these experiments was to develop a dual modality alpha(nu)beta3-targeted nanoparticle molecular imaging agent that affords sensitive nuclear detection in conjunction with high-resolution MR characterization of tumor angiogenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In part 1, New Zealand white rabbits (n = 21) bearing 14d Vx2 tumor received either alpha(nu)beta3-targeted 99mTc nanoparticles at doses of 11, 22, or 44 MBq/kg, nontargeted 99mTc nanoparticles at 22 MBq/kg, or alpha(nu)beta3-targeted 99mTc nanoparticles (22 MBq/kg) competitively inhibited with unlabeled alpha(nu)beta3-nanoparticles. All animals were imaged dynamically over 2 hours with a planar camera using a pinhole collimator. In part 2, the effectiveness of alpha(nu)beta3-targeted 99mTc nanoparticles in the Vx2 rabbit model was demonstrated using clinical SPECT-CT imaging techniques. Next, MR functionality was incorporated into alpha(nu)beta3-targeted 99mTc nanoparticles by inclusion of lipophilic gadolinium chelates into the outer phospholipid layer, and the concept of high sensitivity - high-resolution detection and characterization of tumor angiogenesis was shown using sequential SPECT-CT and MR molecular imaging with 3D neovascular mapping. RESULTS: alpha(nu)beta3-Targeted 99mTc nanoparticles at 22 MBq/kg produced the highest tumor-to-muscle contrast ratio (8.56 +/- 0.13, TMR) versus the 11 MBq/kg (7.32 +/- 0.12) and 44 MBq/kg (6.55 +/- 0.07) doses, (P < 0.05). TMR of nontargeted particles at 22.2 MBq/kg (5.48 +/- 0.09) was less (P < 0.05) than the equivalent dosage of alpha(nu)beta3-targeted 99mTc nanoparticles. Competitively inhibition of 99mTc alpha(nu)beta3-integrin-targeted nanoparticles at 22.2 MBq/kg reduced (P < 0.05) TMR (5.31 +/- 0.06) to the nontargeted control contrast level. Multislice CT imaging could not distinguish the presence of Vx2 tumor implanted in the popliteal fossa from lymph nodes in the same fossa or in the contralateral leg. However, the use of 99mTc alpha(nu)beta3-nanoparticles with SPECT-CT produced a clear neovasculature signal from the tumor that was absent in the nonimplanted hind leg. Using alpha(nu)beta3-targeted 99mTc-gadolinium nanoparticles, the sensitive detection of the Vx2 tumor was extended to allow MR molecular imaging and 3D mapping of angiogenesis in the small tumor, revealing an asymmetrically distributed, patchy neovasculature along the periphery of the cancer. CONCLUSION: Dual modality molecular imaging with alpha(nu)beta3-targeted 99mTc-gadolinium nanoparticles can afford highly sensitive and specific localization of tumor angiogenesis, which can be further characterized with high-resolution MR neovascular mapping, which may predict responsiveness to antiangiogenic therapy.","id":"26345689","pubmedId":"18836386","fileId":null,"editable":true}]
